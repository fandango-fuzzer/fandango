# Shaping Inputs with Constraints

## The Limits of Grammars

So far, all the operations we have performed on our data were _syntax-oriented_ - that is, we could shape the format and structure of our values, but not their _semantics_ - that is, their actual meaning.
Consider our [Person/Age dataset from the previous section](sec:fuzzing).
What would we do if we want the "age" in a specific range?
Or we want it to be odd?
Or we want the age to be distributed in a certain way?

:::margin
All of this refers to _context-free grammars_, which are the ones Fandango uses.
:::

Some of these can be obtained by altering the grammar - limiting the age to two digits at most, for instance, will keep the value below 100 - but others cannot.
Properties that cannot be expressed in a grammar are called _semantic properties_ - in contrast to _syntactical properties_, which is precisely what grammars are good for.


## Specifying Constraints

Fandango solves this problem through a pretty unique feature: It allows users to specify _constraints_ which inputs have to satisfy. These thus narrow down the set of possible inputs.

Constraints are _predicates over grammar symbols_.
Essentially, you write a Boolean expression, using grammar symbols (in `<...>`) to refer to individual elements of the input.

As an example, consider this Fandango constraint:

```
int(<age>) < 50;
```

This constraint takes the `<age>` element from the input and converts it into an integer (all symbols are strings in the first place).
Inputs are produced only if the resulting value is less than 50.

:::{note}
Like grammar rules, constraints in a `.fan` file must end in `;`.
:::

We can add such constraints to any .fan file, say the [`persons.fan`](persons.fan) file from the previous section.
If we do this and run Fandango, we obtain a new set of inputs:

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-input"]
!fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c 'int(<age>) < 50'
```

We see that all persons produced now indeed have an age of less than 50.
Even if an age begins with `0`, it still represents a number below 50.

The language Fandango uses to express constraints is Python, so you can make use of arbitrary Python expressions.
For instance, we can use Python Boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to request values in a range of 25-45:

:::margin
Interestingly, having symbols in `<...>` does not conflict with the rest of Python syntax.
Be sure, though, to leave spaces around `<` and `>` operators to avoid confusion.
:::

```
25 <= int(<age>) and int(<age>) <= 45;
```

and we obtain these inputs:

```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-input"]
!fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c '25 <= int(<age>) and int(<age>) <= 45'
```

Start with [`persons.fan`](persons.fan) and add a constraint such that we generate people whose age is a multiple of 7, as in

```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-input"]
!fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c 'int(<age>) % 7 == 0'
```
(Hint: The modulo operator in Python is `%`).

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: tip, dropdown
This is not too hard. Simply add
```
int(<age>) % 7 == 0;
```
as a constraint.
:::


## Constraints on the Command Line

If you want to experiment with constraints, keeping on editing `.fan` files is a bit cumbersome.
As an alternative, Fandango also allows to specify constraints on the command line.
This is done with the `-c` (constraint) option, followed by the constraint expression (typically in quotes).

Starting with the original [`persons.fan`](persons.fan), we can thus apply age constraints as follows:

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c '25 <= int(<age>) and int(<age>) <= 45'
```

Constraints can be given multiple times, so the above can also be obtained as

```shell
$ fandango fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c '25 <= int(<age>)' -c 'int(<age>) <= 45'
```

:::{note}
On the command line, always put constraints in single quotes (`'...'`), as the angle brackets might otherwise be interpreted as I/O redirection.
:::

When do constraints belong in a `.fan` file, and when on the command line?
As a rule of thumb:

* If a constraint is _necessary_ for obtaining valid input files (i.e. if the inputs would not be accepted otherwise), it belongs into the `.fan` file.
* If a constraint is _optional_, for instance for shaping inputs towards a particular goal, then it can also go on the command line.


## How Fandango Solves Constraints

How does Fandango obtain these inputs?
In a nutshell, Fandango is an _evolutionary_ test generator:

1. It first uses the grammar to generate a _population_ of inputs.
2. It then checks which individual inputs are _closest_ in fulfilling the given constraints.
For instance, for a constraint `int(<X>) == 100`, an input where `<X>` has a value of 90 is closer to fulfillment than one with value of, say 20.
:::margin
Selecting the best inputs is also known as "survival of the fittest"
:::
3. The best inputs are selected, the others are discarded.
4. Fandango then generates new _offspring_ by _mutating_ the remaining inputs, recomputing parts according to grammar rules.
It can also exchange parts with those from other inputs; this is called _crossover_.
5. Fandango then repeats Steps 2-4 until all inputs satisfy the constraints.

All of this happens within Fandango, which runs through these steps with high speed.
The `-v` option (verbose) produces some info on how the algorithm progresses:

```shell
$ fandango -v fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c 'int(<age>) % 7 == 0'
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-input", "scroll-output"]
!fandango -v fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c 'int(<age>) % 7 == 0'
```

```{note}
The `-v` option comes right after `fandango` (and not after `fandango fuzz`), as `-v` affects all commands (and not just `fuzz`).
```

## When Constraints Cannot be Solved

Normally, Fandango continues evolving the population until all inputs satisfy the constraints.
Some constraints, however, may be difficult or even impossible to solve.
After a maximum number of generations (which can be set using `-N`), Fandango stops and produces the inputs it has generated so far.
We can see this if we specify `False` as a constraint:

```shell
$ fandango -v fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c 'False'
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: ["remove-input", "scroll-output"]
!fandango -v fuzz -f persons.fan -n 10 -c 'False'
```

As you see, Fandango still outputs the last population - these "fittest" ones get closest in fulfilling the constraint.
Of course, if the constraint is `False`, then there can be no success.

```{warning}
At this point, outputs produced by Fandango should be seen as "best effort"; they are not guaranteed to satisfy the constraints.
```

In the next section, we'll talk about [custom generators](sec:generators).
